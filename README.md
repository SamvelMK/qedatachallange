### QE COMMUNITY COVID DATA CHALLENGE: April 26 - May 3

This Data Challenge is an opportunity for the international QE community to play a role in helping address the global COVID-19 pandemic. We are uniquely placed to help the world make sense of how people are reacting to this crisis, how those reactions are changing over time and in response to events, and how those responses are differing over time or between places.

The goal of this challenge is to collaboratively analyze public data to generate insights that have the potential to make a difference in public policy or understanding the social and cultural dimensions of this crisis. Ultimately, our findings will be publicized to let the broader public get a deeper understanding of our collective response to COVID-19 and its effects.
